#### 3. Please prepare notes comparing Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText word embedding comparison.


| Word2Vec       | GloVe           | FastText      |
|----------------|:---------------:|--------------:|
|obtained by using a neural network to predict missing words in sentences, and taking the coefficient of the last layer of the neural network as the elements of the word vector  |  focuses on capturing the similarity in context between words. It is lighter and more efficient than word2vec.           |    works with sub-word tokenization and, as a consequence, can handle out-of- vocabulary words.        |
