#### 1. What is the difference between Sigmoid and Softmax activation?
Use cases
* sigmoid function is used for _binary classification_
* softmax is used for _multiclass classification_

Both functions give outputs in terms of probabilities

* For softmax the _sum of all probabilities has to be 1_. And when using it for multiclass classification, the class to be selecetd will have a higher probability than other classes.
* For sigmoid the _sum of probabilities does not have to be one_. 

#### 2. How does cross-entropy loss function change for Binary Classification task vs Multi-Class Classification task?

#### 3. On the Lab Notebook, try running the code with a different dataset of your choice.

#### 4. Apply PCA/T-SNE or both to reduce the N dimensions to 2D space and visualize the word embeddings. Please write-up your observations on the same.
